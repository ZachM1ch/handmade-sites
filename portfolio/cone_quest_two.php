<h1>The Cone Quest 2</h1>
<h3>The Intrepid Journey to Chillville</h3>
<p>The Cone Quest 2 is a third person platformer video game created for TheXPlaceâ€™s second Summer Game Jam (2024). <br>
Myself and 6 other friends and colleagues teamed up to make a game around the theme of travel within a week.  Terrance returns <br>
as the protagonist of this sequel, running and jumping through a house trying to make his way outside and into a coller packed <br>
into a car before the homeowners leave without him.  All of the assets involved were created from scratch by the artists and <br>
sound engineer on my team and were either brand new for this jam or reused from the previous Cone Quest game. My role was one of <br>
three programmers as well as the level designer team lead.  Not all planned assets and features were able to be included in the <br>
narrow time limit, but we have released a small updated version after the jam to bring it closer to our original vision.<br>
<br>Languages and Tools Used: Unity, GitHub Desktop, C#</p>

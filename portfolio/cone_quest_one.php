<h1>The Cone Quest</h1>
<h2>A Sprinkled Climb to the Stars</h2>
<p>The Cone Quest is a third person platformer video game created for TheXPlaceâ€™s first Summer Game Jam.  Myself and 5 other <br>
friends and colleagues teamed up to make a game around the theme of melting within a week.  Given the short timeframe and <br>
the nature of game jams, The Cone Quest is a fairly short game about a little man made out of ice cream named Terrance <br>
jumping across food as he climbs to the top of a refrigerator while slowly melting the whole way up.  All of the assets <br>
involved were created from scratch by the artists and sound engineer on my team.  My role was one of two programmers as well as <br>
the level designer and partial team lead.  Not all planned features were able to be included in the narrow time limit, but <br>
small adjustments were made after the jam ended to bring the game closer to our initial goal.<br>
<br>Languages and Tools Used: Unity, GitHub Desktop, C#</p>

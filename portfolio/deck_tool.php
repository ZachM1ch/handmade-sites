<h1>Magic: the Gathering DeckTool</h1>
<p>Magic: The Gathering DeckTool was something I had come up with a long time ago and knew it would be valuable to have in my <br>
life, but only recently had I taken the initiative to make it real.  There are many websites that have various features that DeckTool <br>
has, but DeckTool is designed to organize many of those features into one central desktop application.  In its current state, DeckTool <br>
is a desktop application for decklist building that optimizes for price and allows for copying and pasting the list in the mass entry <br>
format of the storefront TCGPlayer.com.  Over time I hope to make DeckTool something that will streamline the process to make <br>
and purchase new decks to play this game that I love.<br>
<br>Languages and Tools Used: Python, Tkinter, Scryfall REST API</p>

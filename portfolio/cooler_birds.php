<h1>CoolerBirds.com</h1>
<p>Completed as the final project for an Internet Computing course at Montclair State University in the Spring of 2023, CoolerBirds.com <br>
was a much deeper exploration into web development and design.  The purpose is simply to look at images of birds and read a <br>
little information about each, however, the code behind it was anything but simple.  In spite of that, it became one of the most fun <br>
projects Iâ€™ve worked on and truly expanded my skillset compared to that used for the creation of HFTHR.<br>
<br>Languages and Tools Used: Hostinger, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL</p>
